# Line3D
Generates a line mesh from the `Vector3` points you provide it.

Analogous to [Line2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_line2d.html), but in 3D.

# LinePath3D
An extension of the `Path` node that allows you to define a line using `Path`'s Editor Bezier curve tools.

Bypasses the `Line3D` node, but this will soon use it.
