# LineGen3D
The backbone of Polyliner. Contains line mesh generation functions.

# ImmediateSurface
Experimental interface for generating mesh data for [ImmediateGeometry](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_immediategeometry.html) that resembles [SurfaceTool](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_surfacetool.html).

Doesn't really work, so it's not used.
